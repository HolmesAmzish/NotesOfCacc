例题 Consider the organization of a UNIX file as represented by the i-node. Assume that there are 10 direct block pointers, and a singly, doubly, and triply indirect pointer in each i-node. Further, assume that the system block size and the disk sector size are both 4K.

1. Please describe the structure of i-nodes and data blocks;

2. Assume the size of one data block is 4KB, the disk address is represented as 4 byte unsigned intergers, what is the maximum size of the file that the file system can create?

3. If the disk block pointer is 32 bits, with 8 bits to identify the physical disk and 24 bits to identify the pysical block, then

   a. What is the maximum file size supported by this system?

   b. What is the maximum file system partition supported by this system?

   c. Assuming no infromation other than that the file i-node is already in main memory, how many disk accesses are required to access the byte in position 4321281?
