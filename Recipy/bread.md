## Recepe 1: Simple Air Fryer Bread (Yeast Bread)

**Ingredients**

- Dry yeast: 6g
- Salt: 3g
- Virgin Olive Oil: 1 tablespoon
- Water (warm): 200g
- All-Purpose Flour (or Bread Flour): 250g

**Instructions**

1. Activate Yeast: In a bowl, mix the dry yeast with the warm water, let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy (this show the yeast is active).
2. Combine dry ingredients & oil: in a separate large bowl, mix the salt into the flour. Add the tablespoon of olive oil to the flour mixture.
3. Combine wet and dry: Pout the yeast-water mixture into the flour and oil mixture.
4. Form dough & first rise: Mix everything together until a dough forms, Knead the dough for a few minutes until it's smooth. Cover the bowl with plastic warp or clean kitchen towel and let the dough rest (proof) in a war place for 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.
5. Shape the Dough: After the first rise, lightly flour your work surface. Gently punch down the dough to release the air. Shaping it into a smooth ball.
   - Divide the dough into two parts.
   - Shape each part as desired (e.g., into smaller loaves or rolls).
   - Sprinkle a little flour on top and make a few shallow cuts (scores) on the surface of each dough piece with a sharp knife or bread lame.
6. Second rise (in air fryer): Place the shaped dough into your air fryer basket (ensure it's lined with parchment paper). Let is rest (proof) in the air fryer (turned off) for 30 minutes. This allows the dough to rise again.
7. Air Fryer Baking:
   - Preheat your air fryer to 200 degrees
   - Bake the bread at 200 degrees for 20 minutes.
   - Carefully flip the bread over (turn upside down).
   - Continue baking for another 10 minutes.
8. Cool: Remove from the air fryer and let cool on a wire rack before slicing.

## Recipe 2: Yeast Bread with Higher Hydration (Labeled "Sourdough Bread" but uses Dry Yeast)



**Important Note:** This recipe uses **dry yeast**, not a sourdough starter. Therefore, it will produce a **yeast bread**, not a true sourdough bread which relies on wild yeast and bacteria from a sourdough starter for its characteristic flavor and texture. If you want true sourdough, you would need a sourdough starter and a different process.

**Ingredients:**

- **All-Purpose Flour (or Bread Flour):** 300g
- **Dry Yeast:** 10g
- **Water (warm):** 250g
- **Salt:** 5g
- **Virgin Olive Oil:** 1 tablespoon (similar to the previous recipe, assuming a spoon of oil)

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare Dry & Wet:** In a large bowl, mix the salt into the flour. In a separate bowl, put the dry yeast into the warm water and let it dissolve/activate for a few minutes.
2. **Combine & Mix:** Pour the yeast-water mixture and the olive oil into the flour.
3. **Form Dough & First Rise:** Mix everything until a dough forms. You can knead it lightly. Cover the dough with a lid or plastic wrap and let it **rest (proof)** for 1 hour in a warm place until it doubles in size.
4. **Folding (Optional but Recommended for Structure):** After the first rise, gently fold the dough a few times to "close the hole" (this means strengthening the gluten structure and redistributing the gases in the dough). You can do this by gently stretching one side of the dough up and folding it over the center, then repeating with the other sides.
5. **Shape & Score:** Lightly flour your work surface. Shape the dough into a loaf or round. Make some shallow cuts (scores) on the top surface of the dough.
6. **Second Rise (in Air Fryer):** Place the shaped dough into your air fryer basket (lined with parchment paper). Let it **rest (proof)** in the air fryer (turned off) for 30 minutes.
7. **Air Fryer Baking:**
   - Preheat your air fryer to 200°C (390°F).
   - Bake the bread at 200°C for 20 minutes.
8. **Cool:** Remove from the air fryer and let cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.
