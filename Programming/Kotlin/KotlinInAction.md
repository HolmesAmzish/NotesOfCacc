```kotlin
data class Person(
    val name: String,
    val age: Int? = null
)

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val persons = listOf(Person("Alice"),
                         Person("Bob", age = 29))
    val oldest = person.maxBy(it.age ?: 0)
    println("The oldest is: $oldest")
}
```

# Kotlin basics

## Basic elements: functions and variables

### Hello, World!

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("Hello, world!")
}
```

### Functions

```kotlin
fun max(a: Int, b: Int) {
    return if (a > b) a else b
}
```

```kotlin
fun max(a: Int, b: Int): Int = if (a > b) a else b
```

You can simplify the `max` function even more and omit the return type:

```kotlin
fun max(a: Int, b: Int) = if (a > b) a else b
```

### Variables

In kotlin you start with a keyword, and you may put the type after variable name.

```kotlin
val question = "The Ultimate Question of Lite, the Universe, and Everything"
val answer = 42
```

This example omits the type declarations, but you can also sepcify the type explicitly if you want to:

```kotlin
val answer: Int = 42
```

**MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE VARIABLES**

There are two keywords to declare a variable:

- `val` (from *value*) -- Immutable referencec. A variable declared with `val` can't be reassigned after it's initialized. It corresponds to a final variable in Java.

- `var` (from variable) -- Mutable reference. The value of such a variable can be changed. This declaration coresponds to a regular (non-final) Java variable.



### 4.3.2 Data classes: autogenerated implementations of universal methods

If you add the modifier `data` to your class, all the necessary methods are automatically generated for you:

```kotlin
data class Client(
    val name: String,
    val postalCode: Int
)
```

Now you have a class that overrides all the standard Java methods





Kotlin has the following collections for grouping items:

| Collection type | Description                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lists           | Ordered collections of items                                            |
| Sets            | Unique unordered collections of items                                   |
| Maps            | Sets of key-value pairs where keys are unique and map to only one value |
